# Memory Game
## Introduction
Memory game is a simple javascript game for matching cards. Players can select two cards, attempting to match the icons. If the icons match they remain face up, else they will flip back over. The player wins when all cards are matched.
## Attribution
Much of the css for this game came directly from the Udacity project starter repository.
## Installation
Installation is simple! Just open a bash prompt to the directory where you want to save the project and enter the following commands:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jamesmanone/match-game.git
$ cd match-game
$ yarn install  # npm can be substituted for all yarn commands
```
## Starting the dev server
```bash
$ yarn start
```
It's that easy!
## Exporting production bundle
If you want to build a deployment ready bundle that is also quite easy:
```bash
$ yarn run build
```
